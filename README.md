# Choice Overload (Multiple Choice Questions) game built using Lightning Web Components

Choice Overload is a multi-player game where players have to select one or more correct answers for a question. I've used [Lightning Web Components](https://lwc.dev) to build a version of this game, which you can play using the link below.

## How to play?

1. Navigate to [this Heroku App](https://choice-overload-lwc.herokuapp.com/).
1. The host can click **Start a new game**. The host then has to share the game code with the participants
1. The participants can join the game by entering their name, game code, and by clicking **Join game**.
1. The host sees a spinning wheel that randomly selects a topic, and shows a question on screen.
1. The players can select one or more answers once they see the question.
1. The host can see who selected which answer. Once everyone submits their answers, the host can click **Reveal Answer** to show the correct answers.
1. Click on **Choose another theme** to go back to the spinning wheel.
